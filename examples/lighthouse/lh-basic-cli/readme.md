# lighthouse basic examples: CLI

---

Go to the [GitHub Playbook-Automation published page](https://section508coordinators.github.io/Dev-Automation/)

---

Google lighthouse provides 2 tools that execute accessibility (and other) testing from the command line as described below.

## Tool: Lighthouse CLI

The Lighthouse CLI provides flexibility in how Lighthouse runs and provides the tester with this flexibility within a command line interface (command window).

## Tool: Lighthouse batch

Supports executing [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) analysis *over a number of sites* in sequence and generating a summary report including all of their scores. Scores are calculated from the average score between Performance, PWA, Accessibility and Best Practice and SEO sections.

Also writes out the full `json` report for each site and optionally an `html` report.

---

## Automated tools and rulesets

#### Ruleset assessments and recommended rules

This tool allows the user to pick and choose the individual, underlying rules for testing. Not all automated tool rulesets on the market perfectly align with the pass/fail success criteria as expressed by the DHS standard. However upon analysis, DHS OAST has identified specific rules, for specific vendor accessibility ruleset libraries, that provide value in identifying accessibility to the DHS Standard.

Those analyses of vendor accessibility rulesets and the OAST ruleset recommendations reside in rulesets folder (/rulesets) on this site.

## Examples

#### Example 1

Description: Runs only the audit (test) for accessibility only against one URL, launches a visual instance of Chrome briefly while testing the page then closes chrome and writes a report to your local machine file system. All the while the command window scrolls progress log of all processing going on as it happens:

Command: `lighthouse https://section508coordinators.github.io/BaselineTestPages2/test-cases/TC1005C001.html --only-categories=accessibility` 

***Console window output:***

***Report that is written to file system:***

---

#### Example 2

Description: Runs only the audits (tests) for accessibility against one URL, runs a headless instance of Chrome, sends no processing feedback to command window, and automatically opens the report written to the file system in your browser when done:

Command: `lighthouse https://section508coordinators.github.io/BaselineTestPages2/test-cases/TC1005C001.html --only-categories=accessibility --quiet --chrome-flags="--headless" --view` 

***Console window output:***

---

#### Example 3

Description: Runs only the audits (tests) for accessibility against multiple URLs, runs a headless instance of Chrome, sends no processing feedback to command window, and automatically opens all reports written to the file system in your browser as they finish:

![Example 3 subsequent HTML file for URL 2](pic_ex3_003.png)

---

#### Example 4

Description: Runs a batch of multiple URLs that are pulled from a separate ***siteFile.txt\*** file of URLs, only the audits (tests) for accessibility, runs a headless instance of Chrome, sends no processing feedback to command window, and automatically opens all reports written to the file system in your browser as they finish:

Command: `Lighthouse-batch --file siteFile.txt --html --params "--only-categories=accessibility --quiet --view"`

# Notes

Chrome is run with the following flags to support the widest set of execution environments, including docker containers `--chrome-flags="--no-sandbox --headless --disable-gpu"`. You can replace these with your own by passing `--chrome-flags` as extra parameters. e.g.

```
--params "--chrome-flags=\"--no-sandbox --disable-gpu\""
```
